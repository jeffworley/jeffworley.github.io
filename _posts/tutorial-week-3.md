### Final Draft

Oh hello.  I thought we just spoke in my other journal entry.  You know the one with the oh so clever and creative title of journal-week-3.md?  That's what brought you over here?  Then I had better deliver right?!?!  With that massive expectation set, I shall proceed to underwhelm.  This weeks tutorial will be on Google Chrome Developer Tools.  Note, this will not be a 465 page thumper will details about every single feature but rather it will be an overview of what it is, how you can access it, why you might want to use it, and why I have fallen truly, madly, deeply in love with it over the last week.  I know the 'Savage Garden' reference was painful for me too.  I have no clue why that song popped into my head.

* Q1.)  So what are the Google Chrome Developer Tools?  
* A1.)  Well they are an excellent piece of built in functionality to your Google Chrome browser.  That didn't tell me much.  Sorry.  Just like a widget or built in app it gives you the ability to do something extra. 

* Q2.)  Okay, so how do I access it?  
* A2.)That much is easy.  
  * Step 1.)  When visiting a website that you think looks pretty/cool, has a cool action that it performs, or that you want to learn from, right click on the page and select inspect element from the menu.  This will pop up some plain looking boxes with tabs underneath that site.  
  * Step 2.)  Now that you see that collection of boxes, you want to explore a bit.  Look at each of the tabs and what is contained within them.  I'll get you started off by letting you know that the 'elements' tab contains the `html` for the page you have inspected.  If you _click_ on the 'sources' tab you will see any _scripts_ or _stylesheets_ linked/referenced in the `html`.
  * Step 3.) Get your hands dirty.  Change some of the code in one of the above two tabs.  What happened to the page?  This is a great way to test out a new function, property, element, or style that you have learned about.  It is also a great way to save yourself the effort of building a page from scratch just to play with a few things.

* Q3.)  Why would I care that this is there and why would I want to use it?  
* A3.)  Those are good questions and I am happy that you have brought such a critical eye to this conversation.  You would mainly care that the browser has these capabilities if you are a developer (duh right?!?!?) or someone who is interested in design or becoming a developer.

* Q4/A4.)  Why you might want to use them is because they give you the **POWER** to change those sites.  

* Unecessary Explination of Some Features that Make Me Like This Tool:
   * This brings me to why I have fallen in horibly cliche late 90's love with them.
   * Reason 1.)  Within the tools you will be able to examine the `html` that controls the content of the site in the `element` tab, play with the `css` that makes up the design of the sites in the `console` tab, and attempt to add functionality you think it should have with `javascript` in that same `console` tab.  
   * Reason 2.)  All of this without damaging the website and while being able to see your changes in real time!  
   * Reason 3.)  This is one that I have encountered today.  You may want to use the developer tools as well to confirm that you have properly linked your resources and scripts.  If they are not, they will not show up under the afore mentioned `sources` tab.

Not impressed?!?! Well, I'm sorry that you don't have a good gauge for what is awesome.  While simple to use and easy to explain, this _onion_ has a lot more layers to it that I have yet to discover.  Don't worry.  As I encounter, play with and learn them I will be sure to share them with you in a similar journal post.  Until then, have a good week!
