### Journal Week 2 Final Draft

Hello again!  Well I guess that you are back for a quick check in to see what we learned during the second week of our front-end engineering bootcamp here at the ol' Iron Yard.  To put it succinctly we learned about the DOM (Document Object Model), how to utilize events to manipulate what happens on the DOM, and took strides forward in these endevours through continuing to practice pair programming. Let's get started with that weird DOM thingymagigger.

As I stated above, the DOM stands for the document object model or in other words a structured representation of the document including information on how it can be accessed.  Now I know that sounds all technical and therefore I probably lost a few of you out there so let me tell you why it matters.  It matters because it is the way in which we access the elements of a webpage so that we can manipulate how it looks or behaves.  Some examples of this could be anything from targeting an element type and giving it design input or adding event listeners to specific elements in order to build out functionality.  This is super relevant to what we plan to do for a living.  I almost can't imagine a senario were we won't have to interact with the DOM in some compacity as front-end developers.

Oh its time for those events that I referenced up above.  Its almost like everything we are learning continues to build on and work with one another.  An event is a representation of a DOM event.  Come again?  In simple terms it is how we trigger things to happen when specified parts of the DOM are targeted.  Okay, so what?  Well, this is huge becuase without such interactions the internet would be boring and static.  This means you would visit a page and it would do nothing but present fixed text or pictures.  I don't know about you but that sounds lame.  Does that make sense a bit more?  Good, now on to how we do all this.  We first target a DOM element (for example `var thingy = document.querySelector('.classname');` and then we add an event listener to that DOM element (for example `thingy.addEventListener('click', function(){});` so that it has 'ears' so to speak.  Finally we invoke a function based on an `event` and tell that DOM element what we would like it to do.  That is the best part.

I have now 'dazzled' you with a high level overview of what we covered code wise but I'd like to take this opportunity to talk about how our use of and instruction on pair programming is helping to futher our progression.  So what is it?  Do you even know english?!?!  It is when you work with another developer on a coding project.  So that's it?  Nope.  It can be done in a number of formats.  This involves Pilot/Co-Pilot where one person codes on a computer as the other person contributes verbally with instructions and help.  It could look like Ping-Pong where one person writes a test that fails and challenges the other person to solve it.  This goes back and forth until frustration blows through the roof.  Or it could be as simple as two people on different computers attacking small benchmarks and as they are doing so communicating to one another what they have found, how they are approaching it, and comparing to see if one idea is better than the other and why.  Do adults actually do this or just students?  Adults do it all the time.  Heck, people need to do this in order to make sure that just because something makes sense to them it is in fact the right way of approaching it.  In the industry this is often part of a code review or training exercise to help improve the skill of the team.  Coding is highly collaborative and this is a great way to share knowledge and approaches.

I know it doesn't look like we covered a ton, but I can promise you that the above topics are a bit more time consuming than simple theory and memorization.  That was week one and week two was all about making that prior knowledge translate to real world examples.  I hope we continue to build on these skills and get closer and closer to creating web apps from start to finish.
