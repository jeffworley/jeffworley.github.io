### Final Draft

A little over a month ago now we were asked to do some research into a concept called the "growth mindset."  Once we felt like we had enough information on the subject we were asked to do some self reflection and write about where we felt we fell on the spectrum and why.  At that time I was pretty sure that I had a growth mindset and that I had long since left a fixed mindset behind.  After a month of taking part in this "boot camp" learning process, I think it right to stop and reflect on my initial reflection and self assessment.  Oh nooooooooo!!!!!! Not a relection inception!!!!!!!

So, was I honest with myself and others about my mindset at the time?  I think the answer is no and yes.  I wanted to believe that I had a growth mindset.  Heck, I wanted to think that I exemplified a growth mindset but sometimes what we want and what we currently are is difficult to gauge.  I had always enjoyed taking on new challenges, learning new things, and had an ability to push through what I had thought to be challenges at the time.  That is why, looking back at it now, I thought I was being honest when I initially said yes.  Then why am I now also saying no, I wasn't honest?  I now say no because I don't think that up until this program I have encountered the frequency, severity, and types of challenges I have encountered at The Iron Yard.  Now, having been exposed to those for a little over a month, I have had to push past some predispositions about my intelligence that I hadn't had to before.  Thus proving my inaccurate initial take and current status as somewhat fixed in minset.

Having now addressed my reasonings for this change of perspective I'd like to talk about how I plan to continue to adjust and improve my mindset moving forward.  This is a challenge that I look forward to.  The first step I have taken to address these goals is to seek the council of those whom I trust, know me well and are honest, even if it feels brutal at the time.  Upon discussing my challenges, perceptions, and reactions with them, I was able to see that I have made a couple of key mistakes that are not indicitive of a growth mindset.  The first of those mistakes was to judge my progress based on the progress of others around me.  This gave me a false sense of accomplishment and made me lose focus on the real goal which is trying to understand everything I can about the content I am being exposed to.  I am fixing this by adjusting my focus towards the task at hand which is to dig into everything we do and attempt to explain it simply to myself and others as proof of understanding.  The next mistake I made was to think that hitting a target was the same as hitting a goal.  This too led to a false sense of accomplishment and I am adjusting this now by making sure that I don't judge my progress based on the completion of steps but rather my understanding of the reason and purpose for each of the steps.  My final mistake was to stay in my comfort zone socially.  This has caused me to lose a valuable resource, my team.  It has also prevented me from being able to contribute to my team the way I would need to in the real world.  I am fixing this by taking time each day to share something I feel confident in with the team and to listen to the things that they feel confident in as well.

I know that the above adjustments will aid in my success with this program by forcing me to practice best practices for working in these types of environments.  I am pleased to say that I have already seen dividends from my first take at making these crucial adjustments.  To put my money where my mouth is, I'd like to share some examples of how these adjustments have helped me and my team.  By listening to and studying a classmates approach on a project I was able to bridge a gap in understanding that helped me complete it and helped them reinforce it.  I also was impressed and inspired by a classmates growth mindset when they took it upon themselves to request additional resources to aid in their success. Finally by taking time to share something I felt confident in with a peer, I saw the missing piece click into place which helped them to better understand a concept and helped me to reinforce it too.  I feel confident that I still have a ways to go but am looking forward to the challenge of and rewards from adjusting my mindset and therefore taking as much away from this program as possible.
