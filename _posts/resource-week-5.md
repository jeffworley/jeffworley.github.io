### Final Draft

##### What is my Highlighted Resource this Week?
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

###### Why am I Highlighting this?
* I use it almost everyday for one of three major programming languages:
  * HTML5 (Hyper Text Markup Language)
  * CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
  * JavaScript
* Do you even know who Mozilla is and their importance in the history of the web and these languages?
Mozilla was a project originally for Netscape.  Netscape was the first web browser available to the public and prided itself on open source ideology as well as taming this big thing we call the internet.  As a result they worked tirelessly to document and standardize a lot of the rules of use and creation surrounding the internet.  This has resulted in the glorious MDN docs that devs use all the time as reference nowadays.
* So many resources built into this one:
  * Syntax Docs
    * These are priceless when reading about a function or property that you may need to use when building out code for a project.  They can be dry but once you get used to parsing through the wealth of information, they become your best friend. 
  * Developer Tools
    * These are in my mind and experience the OG's (original gangstas) of built in developer tools.  They allow you to turn your browser into an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) as you explore and try to understand the impressive work that others have submitted to the web. 
  * Guides to Use
    * You know those docs I reference above?  These help make you familiar with those.  Want to be walked through how to do html or css or even basic JavaScript?  These will give you the tl:dr breakdown of the basics so that you can go dig through the rest and extrapolate from there.  My only wish is that I had more time to spend with these.

So why do I bring attention to this invaluable resource?  I think the answer is obvious but I'll say it anyways.  Every developer who wants to be successful and intelligent in their pursuits should be using them.  For all the reasons above I have benefited greatly from them and plan to make continued reading of them as time and need permits.
