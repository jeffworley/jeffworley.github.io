### Rough Draft v2.0

Well hello there again!  If you haven't guessed it already it's that time of the week where I take a few minutes to write about something I learned from the last week of class.  Today, I would like to talk about the subject of responsive web design.  What the heck is responsive web design you say?  Responsive web design is the process of styling your web or app data in a manner that 'responds' to the view port that it is being accessed through.  Sounds pretty straight forward but as I found out last week, being proficient at it is both time consuming and difficult.  Is it worth it?  Abso-freaking-lutely!!!  Have you ever been a fan or regular visitor of a website on a topic of interest to you?  Of course you have.  Now, have you ever been on the go and wanted to access that same site but there was no dedicated app for it?  Then you tried to visit the site on your phone or tablet but man oh man was it jumbled, ugly, unusable, or just plain pathetic. Even better, have you ever resized your browser window to make room for another browswer window or a game window and it looked/functioned horrible too?  This has been experienced by many people, myself included.  Well, that senario is exactly why responsive web design is so important.

Last week I really grasped the concept and reasoning for cultivating this skill but was unable to execute to my level of personal expectation.  Through classroom discussion and reviewing approaches with my peers, I was able to turn this blocker into a dim bulb and hope through repeated practice to convert it to a bright bulb.  A few things you may want to look into if you are curious in diving deeper are, incorporating media queries into your css, utilizing a grid design and frameworks that are available to help you design your entire project around responsiveness.  I know we didn't really dive into a lot this week but don't you fret.  I have also created a separate journal entry in which I will teach you a single topic that we have covered during our 3+ weeks here.  As always thanks for reading and I look forward to sharing more moving forward with the hopes that you find some benefit from it.
