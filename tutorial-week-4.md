##### Points to Cover:
> What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in natural language rather than in a programming language.

> Why Pseudocode?

It provides a great way to "sketch" out your considerations regarding what you want or need your code to do in order to complete a project.  In other words it gives you a way to get the essence of an idea down in concrete form without worrying about the details.  While I am far from perfect at this I have found it helps me to create a tangible road map to follow when starting a new project.

> How to Pseudocode!

Everyone will approach pseudocoding slightly differently.  I am going to share with you my personal approach.

1. Evaluate the goal/s of your project.  For example, the goal of my project will be to recreate a simple but responsive webpage.
2. Then, based on that goal, create benchmarks that you know will need to be achived in order to meet that goal.  For example, I could identify the html elements used on the webpage and skitch out how they look in different viewports.
3. Now that you have your benchmarks, use them as a guide to write down the smaller chunks of the project within each that you can measure your progress by.
4. As a good habit, at this point you may want to go back and see if any of your steps were too big or incorrect and adjust your steps accordingly.

> How Pseudocoding helps with project progress!

Pseudocoding helps with project progress by taking a large or vauge task and breaking it into manageable pieces that can be used to measure progress.  Doing that alone helps most people make better progess but it also makes you think about the overall goal rather than getting lost in the rabbit holes of code to solve a small portion of the project.  Finally, it helps you to be more flexible with your work.  If you have everything mapped out into small chunks and then write code for those within the flow of your dev teams sprint, you can change or fix a portion of your project more easily.

> My personal thoughts on my progress with Pseudocoding!

I really like it.  I still have to go back and add steps that I forgot or that I noticed were lumped in with a big step all the time but I have found it to be a super valuable practice in meeting my assignment deadlines.
