- How to Approach Writing Pseudocode!

##### Points to Cover:
> What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural language rather than in a programming language.

> Why Pseudocode?

It provides a great way to "sketch" out what you want or need your code to do.  Or in other words it gives you a way to get the essence of an idea down in concrete form without worrying about the details.  While I am far from perfect at this I have found it helps me to create a tangible road map to follow when starting a new project.

> How to Pseudocode!

Everyone will approach pseudocoding slightly differently.  I am going to share with you my personal approach.

1. Evaluate your project and determine what your end goal is.  For example, my end goal will be to recreate a simple webpage.
2. Then think of the smallest thing you can do that will move you a step towards that goal.  For example, I could identify the html elements used on the webpage.
3. Then continue repeating step 2 until you have reached your end goal in plain english steps.
4. As a good habit, at this point you may want to go back and see if any of your steps were too big and add smaller steps within them.

> How Pseudocoding helps with project progress!

Pseudocoding helps with project progress by taking a large or vauge task and breaking it into manageable pieces.  Doing that alone helps most people make better progess but it also makes you think about the goal rather than the code/how to solve a small step.  Finally, it helps you to be more flexible with your work.  If you have everything mapped out into small chunks and the code associated with that plain language, you can change or fix a portion of your project more easily.

> My personal thoughts on my progress with Pseudocoding!

I really like it.  I still have to go back and add steps that I forgot or that I noticed were lumped in with a big step but I have found it to be a super valuable practice in meeting my assignment deadlines.
