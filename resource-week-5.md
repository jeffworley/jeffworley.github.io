### Brainstorming Outline v1.0

##### What is my Highlighted Resource this Week?
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

###### Why am I Highlighting this?
* I use it almost everyday for one of three major programming languages:
  * HTML5 (Hyper Text Markup Language)
  * CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
  * JavaScript
* Do you even know who Mozilla is and their importance in the history of the web and these languages?
Mozilla was a project originally for Netscape.  Netscape was the first web browser available to the public and prided itself on open source ideology as well as taming this big thing we call the internet.  As a result they worked tirelessly to document and standardize a lot of the rules of use and creation surrounding the internet.  This has resulted in the glorious MDN docs that devs use all the time as reference nowadays.
* So many resources built into this one:
  * Syntax Docs
  * Developer Tools
  * Guides to Use
