### Brainstorming Outline v1.0

##### What is my Highlighted Resource this Week?
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

###### Why am I Highlighting this?
* I use it almost everyday for one of three major programming languages:
  * HTML5 (Hyper Text Markup Language)
  * CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
  * JavaScript
* Do you even know who Mozilla is and their importance in the history of the web and these languages?
* So many resources built into this one:
  * Syntax Docs
  * Developer Tools
  * Guides to Use
