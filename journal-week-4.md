###### First Take Rough Draft:
A little over a month ago now we were asked to do some research into a concept called the "growth mindset."  Once we felt like we had enough information on the subject we were asked to do some self reflection and write about where we felt we fell on the spectrum and why.  At that time I was pretty sure that I had a growth mindset and that I had long since left a fixed mindset behind.  After a month of taking part in this "boot camp" learning process, I think it right to stop and reflect on my initial reflection and self assessment.  Oh nooooooooo!!!!!! Not a relection inception!!!!!!!

So, was I honest with myself and others about my mindset at the time?  I think the answer is no and yes to the best of my ability to gauge it.  I wanted to believe that I had a growth mindset.  I had always enjoyed taking on new challenges, learning new things, and had an ability to push through what I had thought to be challenges at the time.  That is why, looking back at it now, I thought I was as honest as I could be.  Then why do I also say no I wasn't honest?  I say no because I don't think that up until this program I have encountered the frequency, severity, and types of challenges I have encountered thus far here and now having been exposed to those I have had to push past some predispositions about my intelligence that I hadn't had to before.  Thus I think I had a fixed minset without being aware of it.

I believe the above paragraph addressed my reasoning and how I can to my new conclusion, so now lets talk about how I plan to continue to adjust and improve my mindset moving forward.  This is the challenge that I look forward to.  The first step I have taken to address these goals is to seek the council of those whom I trust, know me well and are honest even if it is brutal at the time.  Upon discussing my challenges, perceptions, and reactions to the events of the last month I was able to see that I have made a couple of key mistakes that are not indicitive of a growth mindset.  The first of those mistakes was to judge my progress based on the progress of others around me.  This gave me a false sense of accomplishment and made me lose focus on the real goal of trying to understand everything I could about the content that I was being exposed to.  I am fixing this by adjusting my focus to the task at hand which is to dig into everything we do and attempt to explain it simply to myself and others as proof of understanding.  The next mistake I made was to think that hitting a target was the same as hitting a goal.  This too led to a false sense of accomplishment and I am adjusting this by now making sure that I don't judge my progress based on completion of steps but rather understanding the reason and purpose of each of the steps.  My final mistake was to stay in my comfort zone socially.  This caused me to lose a valuable resource, my team.  It also prevented me from being able to contribute to my team the way I would need to in the real world.  I am fixing this by taking time each day to share something I feel confident in with the team and to listen to the things that they feel confident in.

I know that this will aid my success in this program by forcing me to practice best practices for working in these types of environments and I have already seen dividends to that extent since I made it my mission to improve.  Some examples of how these adjustments have helped me and my team are; by listening to and studying a classmates approach on a project I was able to bridge a gap in understanding that helped me complete it and helped them reinforce it, I also was impressed and inspired by a classmates growth mindset when they took it upon themselves to source additional resources to aid in their success, and finally by taking time to share something I felt confident in with a peer I saw the missing piece click into place that helped them to better understand a concept.  I feel confident that I still have a ways to go but am looking forward to the challenge and process of adjusting my mindset and therefore taking as much away from this program as possible.
