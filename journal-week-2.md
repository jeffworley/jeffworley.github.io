### Outline of Week 2 Learnings:

#### The DOM:
* What is it?  The document object model or in other words a structured representation of the document including information on how it can be accessed.
* Why does it matter?  It is the way in which we access the elements of a webpage so that we can manipulate how it looks or behaves.
* What are some examples?  This could be anything from targeting an element type and giving it design input or adding event listeners to specific elements in order to build out functionality.
* How relevant is this to what we plan to do for a living?  Super relevant.  I almost can't imagine a senario were we won't have to interact with the DOM in some compacity as front-end developers.

#### Events:
* What is an event? It is a representation of a DOM event.
* Come again?  In simple terms it is how we trigger things to happen when specified parts of the DOM are targeted.
* Okay, so what?  Well, this is huge becuase without such interactions the internet would be boring and static.  This means you would visit a page and it would do nothing but present fixed text or pictures.  I don't know about you but that sounds lame.
* That makes sense but how do you do all this?  Good question!  We first target a DOM element and then we add an event listener to that DOM element so that it has 'ears' so to speak.  Finally we invoke a function based on an `event` and tell that DOM element what we would like it to do.  That is the best part.

#### Pair Programming/Collaborative Programming:
* What is it?  Do you even know english?!?!  It is when you work with another developer on a coding project.
* So that's it?  Nope.  It can be done in a number of formats.  This involves Pilot/Co-Pilot where one person codes on a computer as the other person contributes verbally with instructions and help.  It could look like Ping-Pong where one person writes a test that fails and challenges the other person to solve it.  This goes back and forth until frustration blows through the roof.  Or it could be as simple as two people on different computers attacking small benchmarks and as they are doing so communicating to one another what they have found, how they are approaching it, and comparing to see if one idea is better than the other and why.
* Do adults actually do this or just students?  Adults do it all the time.  In the industry this is often part of a code review or training exercise to help improve the skill of the team.  Coding is highly collaborative and this is a great way to share knowledge and approaches.

##### Short Week:
I know it doesn't look like we covered a ton, but I can promise you that the above topics are a bit more time consuming than simple theory and memorization.  That was week one and week two was all about making that prior knowledge translate to real world examples.  I hope we continue to build on these skills and get closer and closer to creating from start to finish and will see you again tomorrow as I transition this outline to a more rough draft essay like format.
