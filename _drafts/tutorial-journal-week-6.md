### Rough Draft v1.0:

#### What Are We Going to Learn Today?
- How to use Trello for dev projects!

#### Let's Hear Those Steps Then!!!

1. [Create a trello account](https://trello.com)
2. Create a board.  A board can be thought of has a whiteboard, corkboard, or any kind of board one might use to visually represent things to a group.  This will be where we coral our needs to complete our project.
3. Create cards for each one of the features our project will need in order to reach production.  A card/feature should be a chunk of the overall project that is related to one another.  For example we could create a card for our personal information form feature.
4. Add a checklist to our feature card so that whomever is working on it knows what they need to accomplish.  In our above example this would consist of what html needs to be wrote, what css or scss stylings need to be wrote and what javascript functionality we need to create logic for.  These depend largely on the feature and would not be the same for all features.
5. Finally create tracks/lanes to move your feature cards through.  This shows the rest of your team what stage things are in and creates accountability.  It also allows better collaboration so people can help out when someone is stuck or make suggestions.


#### Why Does This Matter?
- Cover importance of project tracking.
- Talk about how this ties into collaborative programming.
- Share a positive personal expereince with trello.
