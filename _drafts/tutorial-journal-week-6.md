### Rough Draft v2.0:

#### What Are We Going to Learn Today?
- How to use Trello for dev projects!

#### Let's Hear Those Steps Then!!!

1. [Create a trello account](https://trello.com)
2. Create a board.  A board can be thought of has a whiteboard, corkboard, or any kind of board one might use to visually represent things to a group.  This will be where we coral our needs to complete our project.
3. Create cards for each one of the features our project will need in order to reach production.  A card/feature should be a chunk of the overall project that is related to one another.  For example we could create a card for our personal information form feature.
4. Add a checklist to our feature card so that whomever is working on it knows what they need to accomplish.  In our above example this would consist of what html needs to be wrote, what css or scss stylings need to be wrote and what javascript functionality we need to create logic for.  These depend largely on the feature and would not be the same for all features.
5. Finally create tracks/lanes to move your feature cards through.  This shows the rest of your team what stage things are in and creates accountability.  It also allows better collaboration so people can help out when someone is stuck or make suggestions.


#### Why Does This Matter?
- Cover importance of project tracking.
Why is it important to track our projects.  Well, there are the obvious reasons like it helps prevent forgetting a key part, it aids administrators in enforcing accountability and it creates a history of how we came to the finished project.  More importantly it helps us communicate better and therefore make our teams better but more on that next.
- Talk about how this ties into collaborative programming.
Like I alluded to above, project tracking is great for collaborative programming.  Software is typically pretty complex and has a lot of moving parts and pieces, most of which dependent on one another to achive their purpose.  By tracking our projects we open up visibility into how those pieces are progressing and allow people to intervene on critical decisions that affect the teams inidividual and collective progress.
- Share a positive personal expereince with trello.
I talked about how I have benefited from using trello a bit in my reflective journal for this week but in case you didn't get a chance to read that, let me ellaborate a bit.  Recently I took part in a group project where we were recreating 4 websites based on blueprints.  We decided to use trello to track our feature progress and communicate to each other how we were tracking compared to our timeline.  This paid off in a big way because it allowed us to both help each other in close to real time when we encountered blockers by providing the steps we were taking, where we were with those steps, what our current code looked like, and a labeling system that helped identify when we needed attention.  All of these resulted in a finished project on schedule.

Thanks for reading this tutorial.  I hope it is somewhat helpful and at worst gives you another tool/topic to look into and see how it may or may not fit in with your teams workflow.
