### [Entity Conversion Calculator](http://www.evotech.net/articles/testjsentities.html)

This small but handy resource has been one that I have had a growing appreciation for as of late.  It's job is simple, to convert values so that we as developers can focus on the proper implementation.  While I am sure there are other uses for this tool, I have been using it to convert html unicode values to css exclusively.  I know that some experienced programmers can do this on their own, but I think as I am a _newbie_ and currently surrounded by other _newbs_ that this would be something to help us get past an obsticle that isn't the focus of our goal.  We will need to include basic icons that don't require large icon library references or load times and this is a great way to pop it in effectively into our css and keep moving.  I hope that you take a quick visit via the title link and see if it may be of any benefit to you as well.
