### Brainstorming Outline v2.0/Rough Draft v1.0

##### Things to Reflect on from Week 5:
* We changed up some of our class rituals.  How did I feel about this?  Why?
Last week we made a change to our classtime structure.  We got rid of three little things and the quiz in an effort to help us catch up and better understand the new challenging content we are encountering.  I really have enjoyed and benefited from these changes.  They have resulted in more direct lecture from our instructors and more explicit instruction on concepts that are pretty challenging.
* We revisited that tricky to master Mocha Chai Testing.  What did I learn this time around?  Did I feel more confident tackling a project when using it for Test Driven Development?
This time around, I learned more about the process of writing tests and was able to connect that to actually writing code for a project in increments.  I feel more confident with it than before by far but still am unsure if I would be able to properly execute this process on my own without any guidance at all.
* We got some explicit instruction on Model View Controller.  In what form did we interact with this?  How did my understanding improve or change?
We revisited the chessboard project, which was to date our most challenging assignment.  Unlike our first pass, this time we had the opportunity to learn a bit more about its construction and how that relates to MVC.  My understanding of both the project and MVC have grown exponentially and I feel as though I would be able to better identify the pieces of a project by this model moving forward.
* We started to learn about API's (Application Programming Interfaces).  What are those?  What did I learn?  How do I feel about that?
API's are interaces that allow different software programs to communicate and work with each other.  They are everywhere and seem to be on the rise even past that as we are moving towards an interconnected digital world.  I am confident in the overall topic of API's but unsure as to proper use of them currently.
* Where am I at personally regarding my progress thus far?  What do I need to focus on this week to continue to make improvements?
I feel as though the content has caught up to my previous exposure and for that I am grateful.  However, I am also nervous because this is where I need to be able to kick things into another gear so that I can continue to build skills that will make me a viable candidate to companies.  I think my mindset shift from last week has helped tremendously and I plan to continue implementing that as well as making strides to better manage my rest.  This is something that I have neglected in an effort to maximize my learning and it has caught up with me in a bad way.
