### Brainstorming Outline v1.0

##### Things to Reflect on from Week 5:
* We changed up some of our class rituals.  How did I feel about this?  Why?
* We revisited that tricky to master Mocha Chai Testing.  What did I learn this time around?  Did I feel more confident tackling a project when using it for Test Driven Development?
* We got some explicit instruction on Model View Controller.  In what form did we interact with this?  How did my understanding improve or change?
* We started to learn about API's (Application Programming Interfaces).  What are those?  What did I learn?  How do I feel about that?
* Where am I at personally regarding my progress thus far?  What do I need to focus on this week to continue to make improvements?
